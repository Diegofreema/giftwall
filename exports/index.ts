  'This quote of Oprah Winfrey gave me the strong drive, to keep touching the lives of the female gender in my own little way. To be a shoulder for helpless women to lean on. A reason for the girl child to have a brighter tomorrow. A channel of smiles, hope and a tiny light into their darkness.',
  "I went through so many difficulties for so many years and was seriously depressed, sleep eluded me. I could not sleep without a pill, was on antidepressants for more than 3 years. At a time I got fed up with life and the only thing on my mind, was to end it all. What's the use of living in so much pain, I gave up on myself severally, but luckily I was  surrounded by people who never gave up and supported me emotionally and physically.",
  'I reached rock-bottom and nothing mattered anymore. Seeing the way people were supportive, their unconditional love, I started having a reason to live, it gave meaning to my life, and my self-confidence returned gradually.',
  'I have been through thick and thin. I know what it means for a child to go to sleep hungry, to not be able to pay your bills, to be hopeless and undocumented in a strange land. For you not to have any rights or get your dream job, because of language and culture barriers, it was like a nightmare. ',
  'Many people are very proud to flaunt different degrees: Bsc to PhD, but the only degree I am proud of today is, the smiles on women faces. They’re regained hope, because of my little kindness, love, support and encouragement.',
  "Life has a way of trying our strength and taking us to the edge of what we think we can endure. It's simple to overlook the inner strength we all possess during those times. It's simple to give in to the idea that we are irreversibly damaged. But I discovered through the heat of my own suffering that brokenness is not the same as failure. ",
  'Meeting many different walls, financial pressures, health issues, depression and anxiety, I decided to embark on this mission of building a community of resilient women, who irrespective of the walls before them, they are determined to go behind those walls with great enthusiasm and find a ray of light into their darkness.',
  'There are many obstacles standing against women, especially in the African continent. These obstacles take many forms, from personal struggles to societal barriers, and they seem insurmountable at times. However, it is crucial to recognize that challenges are an integral part of the human experience. I see challenges in life as walls, because it blocks you from seeing what is on the other side. These walls can be constructed from the bricks of self-doubt, low self esteem, culture, religion, fear, or external limitations. They cast shadows of uncertainty, making it difficult to envision the destination on the other side, but one thing I realised during my struggles in these moments of darkness and doubt that the human spirit shines the brightest, if we persevere and don’t give up on ourselves.',
  "The main thing that distinguishes women, who were able to navigate these walls successfully is their unwavering determination, resilience, and belief in their own capabilities. When faced with adversity, they don't see an indestructible wall, but they it as an opportunity to test their abilities and discover hidden strengths. They understand that it's not the absence of challenges but the way they respond to them that defines their character and shapes their destiny.",
  'In our society, challenges often manifest as systemic inequalities, discrimination, or economic disparities. These walls can be disheartening and seem unyielding, but they also fuel the fires of social change. Throughout history, visionary leaders and ordinary individuals have joined forces to dismantle these barriers. They have rallied for civil rights, gender equality, and economic justice, chipping away at the walls of injustice brick by brick.',
  'We will continue to give our 100% emotional and physical support to women and girls who are in vulnerable situations. This is my spirituality-giving hope, putting smiles and being a voice that speaks against any form of unfairness and injustice done to the female gender, irrespective of their age, religion, race, culture or background. Marygift has been to hell and seen death so close many times, but everything has created the woman, she is today- the Unstoppable Sunshine.',
  'To every woman facing one wall or the other, in your home, workplace, business environment, community, religion or social platforms, I encourage you to stay positive and be strong when confronted with a seemingly insurmountable wall, remember that it is not an endpoint but a new beginning. Embrace the challenge, for on the other side, you may find the fulfillment of your dreams, the strength of your character, and the opportunity to make a lasting impact on the world and together we can achieve this .#togetherwecanmakelivesbetter ',
